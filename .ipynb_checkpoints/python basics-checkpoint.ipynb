    "'''\n",
    "Python is a dynamic, high-level, free open source, and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented \n",
    "programming as well as procedural-oriented programming. In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because \n",
    "it is a dynamically typed language. \n",
    "key features\n",
    " 1.Free and Open Source\n",
    " Python language is freely available at the official website and we can download it latest version from official website.\n",
    " 2. Easy to code\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages \n",
    "like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics .\n",
    "It is also a developer-friendly language. \n",
    " 3.Easy to Read\n",
    "As  we see, learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Python’s syntax is really straightforward. \n",
    "The code block is defined by the indentations rather than by semicolons or brackets.\n",
    "4. Object-Oriented Language\n",
    "One of the key features of Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of \n",
    "classes, object encapsulation, etc.\n",
    "5. GUI Programming Support\n",
    "Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in Python. PyQt5 is the \n",
    "most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.\n",
    "6.High-Level Language\n",
    "Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in Python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, \n",
    "nor do we need to manage the memory.\n",
    "7.Python has gained popularity over the years. Our questions are constantly answered by the enormous StackOverflow community. \n",
    "These websites have already provided answers to many questions about Python, so Python users can consult them as needed.\n",
    "8. Large Standard Library \n",
    "Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own \n",
    "code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in Python such as regular expressions, unit-testing, \n",
    "web browsers, etc."
